Nissan Commercial Vehicles is, you guessed it, the commercial branch of Nissan. They manufacture a series of fantastic work vehicles that you've undoubtedly seen all over town - as soon as you know what one looks like, you can't stop seeing it. I've had the pleasure of working with a small team from Critical Mass based entirely out of our Chicago office. Working with a close-knit group like that can sometimes be a rarity in the agency world, especially in agencies who have offices all over the world, and I wouldn't trade that experience for anything.

The site is run on a Grails back-end, and we utilize a number of different technologies on the front-end. There are a few parts of the site that use Backbone to create a more robust web app experience, and the rest of it is just good old GSPs, Javascript and SASS. I came on to the account in 2013 during a period of major transition. One of the original team members built a framework that was running a lot of the front-end logic on the site. While ambitious, his framework definitely left some things to be desired that could be fixed by refactoring a good chunk of the code and utilizing modern tools. In the time that I've been there, we've implemented a stronger SASS organizational structure, dependency management using Require.js, a component structure utilizing Flight.js, the start of a decent Gulp workflow, and the aforementioned Backbone transitions.

We've facilitated a pretty major overhaul of the look and feel of the site in the past year. Our brand still retained the grittiness that's expected of most commercially-oriented sites, but it's definitely refined itself as our roster has changed.

For instace, during the homepage redesign we took the homepage from this:

<div class="image-container half-image">
  <div>
    <img src="./ncv-home-old.jpg" alt="Old NCV Homepage" />
    <a class="image-caption">Old NCV Homepage</a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="./ncv-home.jpg" alt="New NCV Homepage" />
    <a class="image-caption">New NCV Homepage</a>
  </div>
</div>

Screenshots can only do so much - to fully experience the site, you should definitely go and check it out at <a href="http://nissancommercialvehicles.com" target="_blank">nissancommericalvehicles.com</a>. Some of the pages that I've had the most involvement with are the <a href="http://nissancommercialvehicles.com" target="_blank">home page</a>, the vehicle landing pages for the <a href="http://www.nissancommercialvehicles.com/nv-cargo" target="_blank">NV Cargo</a>, the <a href="http://www.nissancommercialvehicles.com/nv-passenger" target="_blank">NV Passenger</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nissancommercialvehicles.com/nv200-compact-cargo" target="_blank">NV200 Compact Cargo</a>, our <a href="http://www.nissancommercialvehicles.com/way-you-work" target="_blank">"Desinged for the Way You Work"</a> campaign, and the launch of the <a href="http://www.nissancommercialvehicles.com/nv200-taxi" target="_blank">NV200 Taxi</a> for its maiden voyage in NYC.
