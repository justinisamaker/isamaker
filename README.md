My personal portfolio and blog built on Next. Heavily based on the [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) project from Vercel.

## Stuff from their README

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.

To create the blog posts we use [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) to convert the Markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every post is handled by [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and also sent in props to the page.
